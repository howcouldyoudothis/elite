title: Welcome, future hackers!
summary: Welcome to the main page of The Elite Hackers Site. My name is schiz0id, and I have been hacking since I was 13, well over 2 years. People know me as one of the elite, one who knows what they're doing. Since hacking is a true art that isn't learned overnight (more like months), I decided to help those who are destined to master the art of hacking. I will bestow upon all of you information that will guide you along your way, all the way to the end.

    <h2>Who this site is for</h2>
    <p>This site is meant for real hackers. If you're not serious about becoming an elite hacker, then leave. Otherwise, look at the following list and ask yourself if you've ever been through one or more of these situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I think my significant other (girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife, fianc√©) is cheating on me and I want to hack their Facebook or e-mail account to find out.</li>
      <li>I want to hack servers and firewalls and program in code.</li>
      <li>I'm not doing good in school and I want to change my grades.</li>
      <li>I want to bypass my school's web filter and look at blocked web sites.</li>
      <li>I want to hack web sites and not get caught by the F.B.I.</li>
      <li>I want to crack someone's password.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have been in one or more of these situations, then this site is for you. I cover all of that and give you the resources you need to become a real hacker that can do any of these things.</p>
