title:  Black Hat Hacker
---
A Black Hat Hacker is the highest ranked class of hacker out there (think of like having a black belt in karate). They are skilled experts in cracking passwords, servers, firewalls, and accounts. You should not mess with them under any circumstance. They rank higher than both a White Hat Hacker and Red Hat Hacker combined. In order to earn Black Hat status, you must pass rigorous tests and earn your CompTIA Security+ certification (I've earned it and it's hard).
