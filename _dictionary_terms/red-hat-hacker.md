title:  Red Hat Hacker
---
A Red Hat Hacker ranks somewhere between a White Hat Hacker and a Black Hat Hacker (think of like having a red belt in karate). They have an intermediate skill set that allows them to hack into Linux systems, but they are not yet skilled enough to hack into anything really secure like Microsoft Windows servers (only Black Hats can do that).
