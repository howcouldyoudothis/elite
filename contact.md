  <h2>E-mail Form</h2>
  <p>I don't have my e-mail address listed because I don't want to get tracked by the F.B.I. This form is 100% encrypted and will send messages to me on an untraceable server in Russia, so it is safe for you to use.</p>
  <p>I get a lot of e-mails so if I don't respond, try finding me in IRC.</p>

  <h2>Internet IRC Chat</h2>
  <p>IRC is the preferred method hackers used because it is not logged. You can find me at the SoldierX IRC day or night. <strong>MAKE SURE YOU CONNECT WITH SSL IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TRACKED.</strong></p>
  <p>Server: irc.soldierx.com<br>Port: 6697<br>Room: #soldierx</p>
